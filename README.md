A game written in python using pygame over a couple of days

All the files are in one folder. The main py is "project_game.py" located inside the source directory.

All the graphics were made myself in MS paint. All the coding was done myself in IDLE. The code is highly unoptimized because I had just started learning python when I wrote this. So feel free to make changes and optimize it. No licensing and other such hassle. Feel free to get inspiration from the idea if such a thing exists.
