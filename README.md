A game written in python using pygame over a couple of days

All the files are in one folder. The main py is "project_game.py" located inside the source directory.

All the graphics were made myself in MS paint. All the coding was done myself in IDLE. No external dependencies except pygame. The code is highly unoptimized because I had just started learning python when I wrote this.
