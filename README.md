# BrainTrain
A game written in python using pygame over a couple of days

All the files are in one folder. The main py is "project_game.py" located inside the source directory.

All the graphics were made in MS paint. All the coding was done in IDLE. No external dependencies except pygame. The code is highly unoptimized.
